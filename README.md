# Fractal Generator

This Fractal Generator is a Python application that allows you to visualize and explore various types of fractals, including the Mandelbrot set and Julia sets. It provides an interactive interface built with Streamlit and uses popular libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and Plotly.

## Features

- Generate and display the Mandelbrot set with different parameters, including the number of iterations, power, and function type.
- Generate and display Julia sets with different parameters, including the number of iterations, power, and function type.
- Customizable color maps for visualizing fractals.
- Ability to save generated fractal images as PNG files.
- Dark theme for visual comfort.
